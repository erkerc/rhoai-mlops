    "Prerequisite: You have deployed the [RHODS Demo Pack](https://github.com/mamurak/os-mlops/tree/main#rhods-demo-pack) and cloned this repository within a RHODS workbench using the `object detection` workbench image in the `object detection` Project. GPU enablement is optional.\n",

    "### Bucket setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with the demo, ensure the `object-detection` bucket exists in your S3 storage, e.g. in your Minio instance that is referenced in the `object-detection` data connection. In case of Minio:\n",
    "- Call the Minio UI route URL (OCP console: `Networking` -> `Routes` -> `Project`: `minio` -> `minio-ui`).\n",
    "- Log in (use `minio` and `minio123` in case of the RHODS Demo Pack).\n",
    "- Create the `object-detection` bucket in the `Buckets` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU-accelerated inferencing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have enabled GPUs in your cluster, configure GPU usage in your Triton model server instance:\n",
    "- In the RHODS dashboard, navigate to project `object detection` and enter the context menu of the `Triton` model server instance (three dots on the right).\n",
    "- Select _Edit model server_.\n",
    "- Increase the count of `Model server GPUs`.\n",
